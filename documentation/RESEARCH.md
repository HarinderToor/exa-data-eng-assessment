## Research and notes

Main deliverable = Transform FHIR into preferably in tabular format to be used in data analysis (querying etc.)

Inspect FHIR files and context -> Bundles
FHIR is a nested JSON format, so can be parsed with Pydantic or similar 
Large files so need to check the performance of Pydantic vs other options and raw JSON parsing
